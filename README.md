# CyberpunkCombatTracker
This is a small, unofficial, tool used by GMs/Refs/DMs/etc. to speed up the combat in the TTRPG Cyberpunk Red by R. Talsorian.
To run this application, you will first need to have Java SE Development Kit 18, which you can pick up for free from oracle's website.
Once you have the JDK set up, you will want to run the "CyberpunkCombatTracker.jar"

I am just at the beginning of my Java career, and would love constructive criticism / tips to improve my programming. I am also brand new to GitHub, so I apologize for any annoyances and would love feedback/tips.
